Firstly, download Ronnie Sahlberg's libiscsi source and build it.

  $ git clone git://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi.git
  $ cd libiscsi
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make

(Don't type the dollar signs :-)

Next, make a symbolic link from the top directory here to where you have put 
the libiscsi package:

   ln -s /path/to/libiscsi ./libiscsi

Then just run the make file.

Note, this uses a non-recursive make.

You are expected to write your own test programs that link agains the routines.

Eventually there might be a shared library.
