This is a software library that allows you to create SCSI tests.

It layers on top of Ronnie Sahlberg's libiscsi packages (which is why it is
called iSCSILibWrapper). It is written in C++.

It could also wrap other facilities, like SCSI passthrough on Linux or Windows.
(SCSI Passthrough using sg devices on Linux. There are examples of how to do
SCSI Passthrough on Windows out there.)
